:[K[K/[K...skipping...
              Conditional operators such as [1m[7m-f[27m[0m must be unquoted to be
              recognized as primaries.

              When the [1m==[0m and [1m!=[0m operators are used, the string to the right
              of the operator is considered a pattern and matched according to
              the rules described below under [1mPattern[0m [1mMatching[0m.  If the shell
              option [1mnocasematch[0m is enabled, the match is performed without
              regard to the case of alphabetic characters.  The return value
              is 0 if the string matches ([1m==[0m) or does not match ([1m!=[0m) the
              pattern, and 1 otherwise.  Any part of the pattern may be quoted
              to force it to be matched as a string.

              An additional binary operator, [1m=~[0m, is available, with the same
              precedence as [1m==[0m and [1m!=[0m.  When it is used, the string to the
              right of the operator is considered an extended regular
              expression and matched accordingly (as in [4mregex[24m(3)).  The return
              value is 0 if the string matches the pattern, and 1 otherwise.
              If the regular expression is syntactically incorrect, the
              conditional expression's return value is 2.  If the shell option
              [1mnocasematch[0m is enabled, the match is performed without regard to
              the case of alphabetic characters.  Substrings matched by
              parenthesized subexpressions within the regular expression are
              saved in the array variable [1mBASH_REMATCH[0m.  The element of

:[K[K       When [1mbash[0m is started non-interactively, to run a shell script, for

:[K[K       its value if it appears there, and uses the expanded value as the name
:[K[K       of a file to read and execute.  [1mBash[0m behaves as if the following
